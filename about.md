title: About
---

Passionate about software design, I start created an IT service and development Team in a space industry small business.
After an experience in embedded software at Airbus, I have now joined Tiss√©o where I hold a technical leader role.

Having the responsibility of more than 200,000 daily users services is a huge source of motivation and excellence.
Everything must work 24/24 despite the complexity of the underlying systems : mapping, routing, real-time and asynchronous distributed environment.

I also leverage my "user experience" and "digital marketing" sensibilities in the design of our products.

Finally, I have experience and convictions in the OpenSource and OpenData areas.

I live in Toulouse in France.
