_Yes this is a frenglish blog_

Passionate about software design, I held the roles of developer, architect, project manager, team leader and infrastructure manager within various organizations ranging from startups to large company.

I have a "fullstack" operational experience from system administration, front and back web development, to mobile and embedded systems.
This experience was built on systems with several million requests per day, hundreds of thousands of users and very tough SLA.

I have experience and convictions in the OpenSource and OpenData areas and like to share it in this blog.

I live in Toulouse France.
